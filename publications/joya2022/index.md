## Abstract 
Reservation-dwelling American Indian adolescents are at exceedingly high risk for cannabis use. Prevention initiatives to delay onset and escalation of use are needed. School engagement and studentâ€™s positive experiences at school have been identified as key promotive factors against cannabis use in the general population of adolescents, but little work has examined these factors among American Indian youth. Seven school-related promotive factors were examined as predictors of past 30-day cannabis use (measured 6 months later), controlling for previous onset of cannabis use as well as a set of relevant potential confounders. Models were tested using 280 adolescents in 6th or 7th grade at the start of the study from two reservation-based schools in the US. Students were surveyed three times, with six months in between each survey. The average age at the start of the study was 11.99 years (SD = .87) and 54% of participants were female. Using a cumulative logit model to predict past 30-day use, American Indian youth who reported greater school bonding, academic aspirations, proclivity to endeavor in their studies, and interest in school at Wave 2 reported less 30-day cannabis use at Wave 3 (controlling for onset of cannabis at Wave 1 and several other control variables). No evidence of an effect of self-reported grades, perceived safety, or participation in school-related extracurricular activities was found. Given substantial deterioration of these school-related promotive factors over time, and the effect of the school-related promotive factors on subsequent cannabis use, efforts to design and test interventions to promote school engagement as a protective measure against cannabis use is warranted.
