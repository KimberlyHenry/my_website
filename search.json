Details about my section of the course may be found below.\n\nCOURSE DESCRIPTION\nIn this course, students study and master the fundamentals of data science. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that aims to produce insight from data. The focus of Dr. Henry’s section of PSY 350 is on using data science for social good – that is, to help illuminate, understand, and solve the problems in our society that are related to health inequity and social injustice. This takes several forms.\nOver the course of the semester students:\n\nUse R to conduct data analysis and produce beautiful reports with R Markdown\nConstruct data visualizations to describe data\nWrangle data to prepare for data analysis\nAnalyze data\nInterpret and describe findings\nIllustrate uncertainty in statistical estimates\nProduce insight and present new insight to others\n\nThis course is taught as a flipped classroom. Students work through module handouts on their own, and class time is spent on activities that reinforce the material in the handouts.

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nParent–child relationship variables are often measured using a two-part approach. For example, when assessing the warmth of the father–child relationship, a child is first asked if they have contact with their father; if so, the level of warmth they feel toward him is ascertained. In this setting, data on the warmth measure is missing for children without contact with their father, and such missing data can pose a significant methodological and substantive challenge when the variable is used as an outcome or antecedent variable in a model. In both cases, it is advantageous to use an analytic method that simultaneously models whether the child has contact with the father, and if they do, the degree to which the father–child relationship is characterized by warmth. This is particularly relevant when the two-part variable is measured over time, as contact status may change. We offer a pragmatic tutorial for using two-part variables in regression models, including a brief overview of growth modeling, an explanation of the techniques to handle two-part variables as predictors and outcomes in the context of growth modeling, examples with real data, and syntax in both R and Mplus for fitting all discussed models."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nObjective. The aims of this brief report were to examine the extent to which early onset of cannabis use by parents and their children, and intergenerational continuity in early-onset cannabis use by parents and children, differ as a function of parent age at birth of first child.\nMethod. A total of 795 parent–child dyads (57% male parents and 49% male children) were compiled from three intergenerational studies: Oregon Youth Study–Three Generational Study (OYS–3GS), Rochester Youth Development Study and Rochester Intergenerational Study (RYDS–RIGS), and Seattle Social Development Project–The Intergenerational Project (SSDP–TIP). Parents and children identified as non-Hispanic White (29% and 22%, respectively), Black (55% and 47%), and Hispanic (8% and 11%). Early-onset cannabis use was defined as initiation at or before age 15. Time-varying effect models were fit to examine the research questions.\nResults. Among parents, earlier initiation of cannabis use was associated with an earlier entry into parenthood. Moreover, parents’ later age at first birth was predictive of a lower prevalence of early-onset cannabis use among their children. Last, regarding intergenerational continuity, parental early onset of cannabis use increased the likelihood of child early-onset use, but only among older parents (i.e., later age at first birth).\nConclusions. We provide a nuanced examination of the associations between parental and child early-onset cannabis use as a function of parents’ age at first birth and describe a novel approach to incorporating parent’s age at first birth into models of intergenerational continuity."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nReservation-dwelling American Indian adolescents are at exceedingly high risk for cannabis use. Prevention initiatives to delay onset and escalation of use are needed. School engagement and student’s positive experiences at school have been identified as key promotive factors against cannabis use in the general population of adolescents, but little work has examined these factors among American Indian youth. Seven school-related promotive factors were examined as predictors of past 30-day cannabis use (measured 6 months later), controlling for previous onset of cannabis use as well as a set of relevant potential confounders. Models were tested using 280 adolescents in 6th or 7th grade at the start of the study from two reservation-based schools in the US. Students were surveyed three times, with six months in between each survey. The average age at the start of the study was 11.99 years (SD = .87) and 54% of participants were female. Using a cumulative logit model to predict past 30-day use, American Indian youth who reported greater school bonding, academic aspirations, proclivity to endeavor in their studies, and interest in school at Wave 2 reported less 30-day cannabis use at Wave 3 (controlling for onset of cannabis at Wave 1 and several other control variables). No evidence of an effect of self-reported grades, perceived safety, or participation in school-related extracurricular activities was found. Given substantial deterioration of these school-related promotive factors over time, and the effect of the school-related promotive factors on subsequent cannabis use, efforts to design and test interventions to promote school engagement as a protective measure against cannabis use is warranted."
