Welcome, thank you for stopping by
:::

I am a Professor of Psychology and Public Health at Colorado State University. As a behavioral scientist oriented toward prevention, my work focuses on the psychological and social factors that produce or mitigate the health risking behaviors of adolescents and young adults. My goals are to develop and test theoretical models in order to understand the complex interactions of risk, promotive, and protective factors that influence these risk behaviors and, ultimately, to create and test methods for prevention.
